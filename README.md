🧾 CrewTrack System

CrewTrack is a web-based workforce management system designed to help supervisors and house managers efficiently manage staff attendance, shift scheduling, and payroll generation.
This project was developed as part of my academic coursework to demonstrate practical skills in full-stack web development using Node.js, MySQL, HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

📋 Overview

CrewTrack streamlines daily operations by providing dedicated dashboards for different user roles:

Housekeepers can check in/out, view their assigned shifts, and review payment information.

Supervisors can assign shifts, monitor attendance, and review completed work.

House Managers can generate and manage payroll, approve or reject payments, and view detailed activity logs.

This project emphasizes data integrity, real-time updates, and clear UI design to simulate a practical workforce management solution.
